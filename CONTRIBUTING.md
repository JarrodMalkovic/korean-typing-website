## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes To The Main Branch Happen Through Pull Requests

1. Update your local repo with `git pull origin main`,
2. Create a working branch with `git checkout -b MyNewBranch`
3. Make your changes on your branch and stage them with `git add .`
4. Commit your changes locally with `git commit -m "description of your commit"`
5. Upload the changes (including your new branch) to GitHub with `git push origin MyNewBranch`
6. Go to the main repo on GitHub where you should now see your new branch
7. Click on your branch name
8. Click on “Pull Request” button
9. Click on “Send Pull Request”

## Report bugs using Github's issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/furbukit/CITS3200/issues)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

### For the client JavaScript code

- Use the Prettier Code Automatter.
- With Prettier, everytime you save a JavaScript file it will be autoformatted acccording to the rules set in the .prettierrc file inside the client directory, ensuring that all JavaScript files are formatted the same way
- Instructions to setup Prettier with VSCode can be found [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/code-formatting-with-prettier-in-visual-studio-code)
